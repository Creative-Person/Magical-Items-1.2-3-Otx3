# Magical Items TFS 1.2/3 & Otx3
Magical items is a tiered based system which affects all items that can be equipped to a player.

There is a <a href="https://github.com/Codex-NG17/Magical-Items-1.2-3-Otx3/wiki">wiki</a> of the methods so far, when I have time I will add more methods to this library and update the wiki to reflect these changes.

In time I will integrate all my systems with magical items and re-write it completely to be more optimized.
